## syntax-case

The `syntax-case` system was the first to effectively integrate procedural macros, hygiene, and a pattern matching and templating language.

Pages 1-6 of "Syntactic Abstraction: The syntax-case expander" provides the best introduction to the system and the problems it is trying to solve (https://guenchi.github.io/Scheme/doc/Syntactic%20Abstraction%20the%20Syntax-Case%20Expander.pdf).

Then, page 9 onwards of "Syntactic Abstraction in Scheme" provides the best explanation of the hygiene algorithm (https://scholarworks.iu.edu/iuswrrest/api/core/bitstreams/3f729d08-c698-4430-9d04-6a782c5b9300/content).
